# Machine Learning Projects

An assortment of coding projects from COMS W4771: Machine Learning.

Project 1:
Using K Nearest Neighbor classification and Maximum Likelihood Estimation on a handwritten digit dataset.

Project 2:
Working with SVM and playing with hyperparameters on custom datasets (moons and rolls) as well as on the same handwritten digit dataset as in Project 1.
